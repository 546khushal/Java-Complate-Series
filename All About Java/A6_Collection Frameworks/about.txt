=> Collections in java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects. 

=>All the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, 
    deletion etc. can be performed by Java Collections. 

=>Java Collection simply means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many 
interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque etc.) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, 
PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet etc). 

=>What is framework in java 
    provides readymade architecture. 
    represents set of classes and interface. 
    is optional.

What is Collection framework  
    Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating group of 
    objects. It has: 
 
    1. Interfaces and its implementations i.e. classes 
    2. Algorithm
