/**
 * INHERITANCE: IS-A relationship where child class acquires properties of parent class.
 *Inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors 
of parent object. 

*Why use inheritance in java 
o For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved). 
o For Code Reusability. 
 
 * Types:
 * 1. Single (1 parent → 1 child)
 * 2. Multilevel (Grandparent → Parent → Child)
 * 3. Hierarchical (1 parent → multiple children)

 *Hybrid Inheritance (Not Supported in Java):
    A combination of two or more types of inheritance. Java avoids hybrid inheritance due to ambiguity issues (like the diamond problem) in multiple inheritance.

*Multiple Inheritance (Using Interfaces):
    A class can implement multiple interfaces to achieve multiple inheritance behavior.
    interface A { }
    interface B { }
    class C implements A, B { }
