File I/O means reading from and writing to files using Java classes from the java.io and java.nio packages.
Java supports both:
    Character streams (Reader, Writer)
    Byte streams (InputStream, OutputStream)

| Class              | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `File`             | Handle file/folder (create, delete, path) |
| `FileReader`       | Read file character-by-character          |
| `FileWriter`       | Write characters to a file                |
| `BufferedReader`   | Read text efficiently (line by line)      |
| `BufferedWriter`   | Write text efficiently                    |
| `Scanner`          | Easy file reading (line-by-line/word)     |
| `PrintWriter`      | Easier writing with `println()`           |
| `FileInputStream`  | Read bytes (image, binary files)          |
| `FileOutputStream` | Write bytes to file                       |
| `Paths`, `Files`   | From `java.nio.file` â€“ newer APIs         |
